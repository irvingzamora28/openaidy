Thank you for your feedback. You can actually use Momentum without entering your email or creating an account. While we highly encourage creating an account, we allow immediate access for users without any signup. After installing Momentum, just click on the 'Stay logged out' button that appears on the \\\\\\\"What's your email?\\\\\\\" page. Few things to keep in mind about having a Momentum account: - Your account syncs your Momentum data so you can log in from other computers to see all of your Momentum data (Focus, Todos, Links, etc.). - Your account automatically backs up your Momentum data so you won't lose any data if your computer runs into any problems. - Your will sync between multiple browsers and devices (e.g. your work/home computers and Google Chrome/Firefox/Microsoft Edge).
