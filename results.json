Momentum relies on the latest versions of Chrome, which unfortunately aren’t available on Windows 7 as these platforms no longer receive updates or security patches from Microsoft or browser vendors like Google. Because of this, some features may not work properly on older systems. We truly appreciate you giving Momentum a try, and we’ll be here to assist you if things change down the road or you ever have access to a more current setup. 😊\\\\n          - button \\\\\\\"Reply options\\\\\\\" [ref=e586] [cursor=pointer]:\\\\n            - img [ref=e590] [cursor=pointer]\\\\n      - generic [ref=e594]:\\\\n        - img \\\\\\\"Review\\'s profile picture\\\\\\\" [ref=e595]\\\\n        - heading \\\\\\\"Ayaan Shah 1 out of 5 stars Apr 16, 2025\\\\\\\" [level=3] [ref=e597]:\\\\n          - generic [ref=e598]: Ayaan Shah\\\\n          - img \\\\\\\"1 out of 5 stars\\\\\\\" [ref=e599]:\\\\n            - generic [ref=e600]:\\\\n              - generic [ref=e601]:\\\\n                - img [ref=e602]\\\\n                - img [ref=e605]\\\\n                - img [ref=e608]\\\\n                - img [ref=e611]\\\\n                - img [ref=e614]\\\\n              - generic [ref=e617]:\\\\n                - img [ref=e618]\\\\n                - img [ref=e620]\\\\n                - img [ref=e622]\\\\n                - img [ref=e624]\\\\n                - img [ref=e626]\\\\n          - generic [ref=e628]: Apr 16, 2025\\\\n        - button \\\\\\\"Review options\\\\\\\" [ref=e632] [cursor=pointer]:\\\\n          - img [ref=e636] [cursor=pointer]\\\\n        - paragraph [ref=e640]: Hi guys this is an honest review of the shittiest extension ever In all honesty, this extension is way too overused and doesnt really suit my purpose like i hate looking at the same old regular windows desktop wallpaper style images it ruins my productivity to a major extent ive found I recently tried this new extension called \\'Aivatab,\\' which is genuinely better in most aspects I highly recommend Aivatab\\\\n        - generic [ref=e642]: 5 out of 16 found this helpful\\\\n        - generic [ref=e643]:\\\\n          - img \\\\\\\"Replier\\'s profile picture\\\\\\\" [ref=e644]\\\\n          - generic [ref=e645]:\\\\n            - heading \\\\\\\"Momentum Help Developer Apr 24, 2025\\\\\\\" [level=4] [ref=e646]:\\\\n              - generic [ref=e647]: Momentum Help\\\\n              - generic [ref=e648]: Developer\\\\n              - generic [ref=e649]: Apr 24, 2025\\\\n            - paragraph [ref=e650]: Hi Ayaan, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.
